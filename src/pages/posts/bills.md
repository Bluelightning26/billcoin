**We use** them every day.
But how did they come to be?
What gives a piece of paper such intricate value?!?

Paper currency originated in different parts of the world at different times in history
The oldest one we know of is from the 7th Century Tang Dynasty in China.

>"Merchants would issue what are today called promissory notes in the form of receipts of deposit to wholesalers to avoid using the heavy bulk of copper coinage in large commercial transactions."
