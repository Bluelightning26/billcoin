hi there, i'm dhyan! a high school junior from New England!

i've always been fascinated by the existence of money.
A simple piece of paper, or a small metal piece can hold an enormous amount of value that is worth tenfold itself.

Only due to a promise. 
A promise that it can be exchanged for goods and services, and is often backed by a government. 
It is truly a testament to the power of human trust and cooperation.


This is a small project of mine that explores some basic currency information (a few concepts too!!) and was created using Astro.
The primary purpose of creating this corner of the internet was learning Astro, and this blog is a fun byproduct :p

everything is open-source [on GitHub](https://github.com/Bluelightning26/billcoin)!

hope you enjoy! - dhyan
