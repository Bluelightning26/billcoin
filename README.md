created in astro! :D

i've always been fascinated by the existence of money.
A simple piece of paper, or a small metal piece can hold an enormous amount of value that is worth tenfold itself.


This is a small project of mine that explores some basic currency information (a few concepts too!!) and was created using Astro.
The primary purpose of creating this corner of the internet was learning Astro, and this half-finished blog is a fun byproduct :p
